This Zen simulation is based on the C version v1600003.248b
by Leonard Richardson (C) 1997, 2000.
Written originally for the Nerth Pork robotfindskitten contest.
Reimplemented in Inform by David Griffith (C) 2002.

In this game, you are Robot (#).  Your job is to find Kitten.  This
task is complicated by the existance of various things which are not
kitten.  Robot must touch items to determine if they are Kitten or
not.  Move Robot with the cursor keys, the numeric keypad, or
using the vi/rogue movement keys. The game ends when robotfindskitten.
Alternatively, you may end the game by hitting the Esc or Q keys.


=========
Build: ||
=========
The NKI files need to be converted into a form that can be included in 
an Inform6 program.  A Perl script, nki2inf.pl, is provided for this 
purpose.  Invoke it like this: "nki2inf.pl *.nki > nki.inf".  Now you 
can invoke Inform6 on kitten.inf

Notes ||
========
1) More than half of the code is taken up by non kitten items
   (NKIs).  When I compiled the code with just five messages and
   no debugging code, the resulting binary was less than 10k bytes.

2) If it wasn't already abundantly obvious, this program won't
   compile to Glulx because of copious use of Z-machine assembly
   instructions.
      
3) Compiling for V5 or higher is required due to "style" calls.
   Is there a reason why someone would want to compile this for V4
   or previous?
